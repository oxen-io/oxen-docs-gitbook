_Just looking for the latest Oxen Wallet releases?_ [_Head to our downloads page_](https://github.com/oxen-io/oxen-electron-gui-wallet/releases)_._

The Oxen Wallet is your gateway to private decentralised transactions and communications. It allows you to hold and secure your $OXEN, stake into Oxen Service Nodes, and transact with $OXEN.

The Oxen wallet stores a collection of public and private keys which can be used to receive, view, or spend $OXEN.

The wallet uses these private keys through a daemon which synchronises with the Oxen network to scan for incoming transactions and send outgoing transactions.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Wallet

The Oxen GUI Wallet, also referred to as the Oxen Electron Wallet, is the most user-friendly Oxen wallet. It has a graphical interface (like most PC applications), which is perfect for beginners or those just looking to store and send their Oxen. The GUI Wallet is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
