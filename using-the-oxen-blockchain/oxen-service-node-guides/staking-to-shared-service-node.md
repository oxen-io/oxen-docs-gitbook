# 💸 Staking to a shared Oxen Service Node

This document explains how to stake via the Oxen GUI Wallet.

The latest version of the wallet can be downloaded [here](../../downloads.md).

Please keep in mind, one can **only stake via an open pool with the GUI wallet**.



## GUI Wallet Guide

### Step 1

Open the Oxen GUI Wallet, enter your password, and let it fully sync to the latest blockheight.

### Step 2

Click on the `SERVICE NODE` button.

### Step 3

On this step you will need to enter the service node public key obtained from the node operator (or [OxenSN](https://oxensn.com/)) and the amount of Oxen you are contributing to the node.&#x20;

This can be done automatically by clicking `STAKE` on one of the listed Service Nodes awaiting contribution in the wallet interface.

### Step 4

Once that is filled out, simply hit the `STAKE` button.

> Please note, if you receive an error at this step you will need to click the `SWEEP ALL` before you can stake from your wallet.

Congratulations, you're now staked!
