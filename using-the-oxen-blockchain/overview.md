### üí∏ $OXEN and the üí∞Oxen Wallet: Private instant transactions

The Oxen Wallet, available in user-friendly GUI or powerful CLI versions, enables you to send and receive private anonymous transactions in the blink of an eye. You can download your preferred Wallet version [here](https://github.com/oxen-io/oxen-electron-gui-wallet/releases).

### üñ• Oxen Service Nodes: Earn $OXEN rewards for powering up the Oxen network

Running an Oxen Service Node is a great way to grow the Oxen network and support the project while receiving $OXEN rewards for your valuable contribution. Check out our guides to [setting up a service node](oxen-service-node-guides/setting-up-an-oxen-service-node.md) and [staking to a service node](oxen-service-node-guides/staking-to-shared-service-node.md), or [see here](oxen-service-node-guides/service-node-tools-upkeep.md) for some service node tools and utilities to help with starting up and maintaining your service nodes.

### Oxen Name System (ONS): Human-readable names for Session, Lokinet, and more

Oxen Name System enables you to register alphanumeric names to be used in place of the long, hard-to-use default formats for Lokinet addresses, Session IDs, and Oxen Wallet addresses. For a look at registering names using ONS, [check out our guide](using-oxen-name-system.md).
